-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYTRAFFICLOG plays your logged traffic in IRC-isalike Traffic.
Example:
PLAYTRAFFICLOG #leet 03-02-99 13:20:00 03-02-99 14:20:00 :JOIN
would show you any lines containing JOIN (in most cases 
channeljoins) from 03-02-99 13:20:00 to 03-02-99 14:20:00.
The Traffic itself will be played as it was recorded, so it
will appear in the channel if you sourced a channel.
source must be a full qualified Nickname or channel.
Date always has to be the format mm-dd-yy.
Time always has to be hh:mm:ss.
Any digit has to be two letters.
Also you can use:
PLAYTRAFFICLOG last
you will get the last log entrys since you played PLAYTRAFFICLOG last the last
time or you deleted the log (see ERASETRAFFICLOG).
Some Hints about logging:
- you should filter loggings, or possibly would get an
  extensive amount of diskspace usage.
  If you got a quota on your shell, you should use this
  functionality with maximum care or possibly run out of
  diskspace fast.
- logging only will happen, if you are NOT connected to
  the bouncer.
- If you define * as filter, then anything that happens
  to the source will be logged.  
- You need to care about erasing the traffic log.
  That happens using ERASETRAFFICLOG. It will erase
  the whole logfile and start a new one.
