ADDSERVER [network'][S=]server :port password
---------------------------------------------
adds a new IRC server. You can add many servers. If the bouncer can't connect 
to a server it will try next one in list. 
If you put an S= in front of the Hostname, the bouncer will try to
establish a SSL-Connection.
Example: 
ADDSERVER irc.stealth.net :6667
