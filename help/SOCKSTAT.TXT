SOCKSTAT
--------
displays the current status of all connected sockets, included
accounting informations, encryption informations etc.
This command can be also used to delete possibly expired sockets
from the socket array. If you trigger SOCKSTAT, the socket
debug information will also be written to the MAIN-Log.
You can also trigger the logging of socketstats by sending
the USR1 signal on the shell.
Example:
/SOCKSTAT
