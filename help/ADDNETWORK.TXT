ADDNETWORK name
---------------
This functionality allows you to use multiple connections to different
ircnetworks to the single connection you are keeping to the bouncer.
So it is possibly for you to get a client in your favourite network also
to secondary networks you also are on.
Example:
ADDNETWORK Ef
Would add a new network token named Ef to your userspecifications.
For any added network, you can use the functions seperately, for example:
ADDSERVER Ef'irc.freei.net:6667
would add a server for your newly added network token. The bouncer would open
a second outgoing connection and relay it to your single client connection
by prefixing Users and channels with the network token. Channel #sausage
would be on that network #Ef'#sausage. Nicks also get prefixed, so the
User johndoe on EfNet would appear as Ef'johndoe.
Every command can be prefixed with the network token and would then be
executed for your networked client.
