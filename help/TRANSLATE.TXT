Currently possibly are the following translations:
- English to German           en_de
- English to Italian          en_it
- English to French           en_fr
- English to Portugese        en_pt
- English to Chinese          en_zh
- English to Japanese 	      en_ja
- English to Korean           en_ko
- English to Spanish	      en_es
- English to Russian	      en_ru
- Deutsch to English          de_en
- Italian zu English          it_en
- French to English    	      fr_en
- Portugese to English        pt_en
- Japanese to English         ja_en
- Korean to English           ko_en
- Russian to English          ru_en
- Spanish to English          es_en
- French to German     	      fr_de
- German to French     	      de_fr
You need to set a channel or a user to be translated and two
of the language identifiers (see behind the languages).
Example:
/TRANSLATE #italia :it_en en_it
So everything you would get FROM the channel #italia
would be translated from italian to english, and in return everything
you would post to #italia, would be translated from
english into italian.
